# Finance and Risk Analytics Problem
Provide consultation to two different investors, Mr. Patrick Jyenger and Mr. Peter Jyenger based on their requirements and financial objectives.

## Project Explanation
In this Capstone Project, as part of my Masters in Data Science Capstone Project at WOOLF University (UpGrad), I demonstrate how to create customized investment portfolios for two investors based on their unique risk tolerance and return requirements. 

Using stock data analysis, I walk you through my methodology and show you how I identified the best stocks to include in each portfolio.

## Business Case
In the recent past, the industry of wealth management has seen a lot of growth. Individuals and businesses actively seek maximum returns. However, in many cases, they lack either the skills to identify the right investment opportunities or the time to find such opportunities. This challenge gave rise to the dedicated individuals who perform this task on behalf of the investors for a commission: portfolio managers.

 A portfolio manager makes investment decisions and carries out other related activities on behalf of vested investors. They work with a team of analysts and researchers, and their main objective is to realize the needs of the investor and suggest a suitable portfolio that meets all the expectations. They are responsible for establishing the best investment strategy and selecting appropriate investments with the right allocations. However, in doing so, they face a lot of competition in the form of other portfolio managers and rival firms. Therefore, the portfolio manager has to use the available resources to provide the best solution to the investor.

 Consider yourself working for an associate at an investment firm that manages accounts for private clients. Your role requires you to analyze a portfolio of stocks to provide consultation on investment management based on client requirements.

 Your task is to provide consultation to two different investors, Mr. Patrick Jyenger and Mr. Peter Jyenger based on their requirements and financial objectives. You can refer to the elements mentioned in the video to develop the investor persona. The image below summarizes the profile of the two investors:

You must perform the required steps for both the individuals after understanding the investor persona independently.

**Following points summarise the expected tasks in the assignment:**

1. You must use the elements of technical analysis to understand the trend of the underlying stocks. The metrics associated with risk and returns must help you realise whether the security meets the criteria of your investorâ€™s financial goals.
2. You must use the metrics and the visualisations to compare the performance of the available securities against each other, and also against the market index, S&P500.
3. The findings should be aligned with the investor persona to select the appropriate stocks for the portfolio.
4. After the selection of stocks, the portfolio must be validated using the active investment strategy to estimate the prices in future. You must check if the portfolio has the potential to fulfil the financial goals set by the investor.
